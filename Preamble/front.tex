%\begin{info}
%	\textbf{Draft mode is ON}

%	Yellow boxes with info and tips for writing will appear.

%	Setting the draft option will speed up compilation of the PDF, because figures are not loaded, just indicated by a frame. Other package specific simplifications are also enabled, like removing hyperrefs. 

%	LaTeX will also inform you about hyphenation (Overfull hbox warning) and justification problems with a small black square. You can find these in the console after compiling.

%	\emph{To disable:} Delete the draft option or replace it with final in the final document version. This is done at the top of the \emph{main.tex} file.
