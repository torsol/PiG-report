According to the International Maritime Organization (IMO), an automatic Identification system (AIS) must be able to provide information about the ship and broadcast it to other ships and coastal authorities. In 2000, IMO adapted a new regulation, requiring that AIS must provide information, including identity, type, position, course, speed, and other safety related information. Transcievers must be able to both send out and receive such signals from other ships.  The requlation also stated that all ships of 300 gross tonnage or above engaging on international voyages, as well as all cargo ships above 500 gross tonnage and all passanger ships must be equipped with such technology.
