\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chp:introduction}
\begin{info}
	The first chapter of a well-structured thesis is always an introduction, setting the scene with background, problem description, objectives, limitations, and then looking ahead to summarize what is in the rest of the report. This is the part that readers look at first---\emph{so make sure it hooks them!} Problem formulation, Related work, What remains to be done
\end{info}
%%-----------------------------------------


%%=========================================
\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}
\begin{info}
	In this section, you should present the problem that you are going to investigate or analyse; why this problem is of interest; what has, so far, been done to solve the problem, and which parts of the problem that remain. Should include \textbf{Problem Formulation}, \textbf{Related Work}, \textbf{What Remains to be Done?}.
\end{info}
%%-----------------------------------------
\begin{info}
	What am I doing
\end{info}
In this paper, I will investigate available maritime navigational data in order to create a foundation for my future master thesis. The main task for my master thesis is to match AIS-data with ship detections done by VAKE's deep learning algorithm. In order to facilitate this I need an in-depth look at what data I have to work with and how I can utilize it in order to create a good model for AIS/Detection-matching.

\begin{info}
	Why is this interesting
\end{info}

While there exists many established ways of tracking ships at sea, all solutions depends on their technological limiations and the cooperation of the ships themselves.

\begin{info}
	What has, so far, been done to solve the problem
\end{info}
Identifying detections of boats on satelitte imagery to their respective AIS-signature is currently a part of the Vake pipeline. However, their method is a naive interpolation of the ships last known point before detection and first point after detection. For large time periods and/or advanced ship motion, this approach does not capture nearly as many ships as more advances trajectory modeling hopefully can do.

\begin{info}
	What remains?
\end{info}
There is a lot that remains, eventhough AIS-predicition and forecasting is an increasingly researched topic. This particular case of trajectory reconstruction is not feasible yet.

\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}
\begin{info}
	The objectives shall be written as \emph{fundamental objectives} telling what to do and not \emph{means objectives} telling how to do it.

	All objectives shall be stated such that we, after having read the thesis, can see whether or not you have met the objective. ``To become familiar with \ldots'' is therefore not a suitable objective.
\end{info}
%%-----------------------------------------
Objectives should be quantifiable and concise, a reader should know if I have succeeded with my objectives after reading my paper. Therefore, I will strive to formulate objectives in such a way. Also, they will express what I have to do, not how I do it. 

In order to create the best foundation for my master thesis, I need an in-depth knowledge of the data sources I have available, what state-of-the-art research has been conducted on the domain, and what tools that will give me the best possibility to succeed with my work. I have therefore formulated the following goals aiming to achieve this:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Summarize what AIS data is
	\item Summarize what AIS data is available for this project
	\item Summarize what other data is available from Vake
	\item Summarize the current implementation at Vake and identify key takeaways
	\item Summarize what tools is available for big data analysis
\end{enumerate}

Next up is establishing knowledge of the state-of-the-art methods utilized to handle AIS-data and to use AIS-data in predictions
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Summarize preprocessing done on AIS-data and why it could be necessary
	\item Summarize different models of predicitions on AIS-data
\end{enumerate}

Lastly, I will conduct preprocessing and feature engineering on the data in order to establish a framework to expand upon in the master thesis
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Explain why preprocessing could be helpful
	\item List and show relevant preprocessing reducing the amount of data
	\item Explain the process of feature engineering
	\item List and show relevant feature extraction from the available AIS-data
\end{enumerate}

\section{Approach}
\label{sec:approach}
\begin{info}
	Here you should describe the (scientific) approach and experiments that you will use or have used to solve the problem and meet your objectives and tasks. Experiments may in this context relate analyses you need to carry out in order to investigate a specific hypothesis, task objective, or similar. You should specify the approach and experiments for each objective and/or task. It is preferred that you supplement your explanation of the approach with an illustration.

	If there are any ethical problems related to your approach, these should be highlighted and discussed.
\end{info}

\section{Contributions}
\label{sec:contributions}
\begin{info}
	Here you give a list of your main contributions in the project or master work.
\end{info}
%%-----------------------------------------
\begin{enumerate}
	\item A short analysis of the weaknesses of the current implementation
	\item A benchmarking of the current AIS-matching
	\item New pipeline for processing AIS-data for future predictions
	\item New recipies for feature extraction of AIS messages
\end{enumerate}

\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:limitations}
\begin{info}
	In this section you describe the limitations of your study. These may be related to the study object (physical limitations, operational limitations), to the environmental and operational conditions, to the thoroughness of the analysis, and so on.
\end{info}
%%-----------------------------------------
The limitations of this pre-study has to do with scope and how the data is processed. An ideal solution to this problem is a generalized algorithm that works in all timezones, all over the earth and that can make advanced predictions using all data available at near real time. 

For this pre-study I have focused on one \cite{Tofting2018} particular MGRS-tile, with a small subset of the total data, using features that is powered by local data. A prediction model developed on this data will probably not be able to generalize well for other tiles than the selected one.

\section{Outline}
\label{sec:outline}
\begin{info}
	Here, you give an overview of how the remaining part of the report is organized.
\end{info}
%%-----------------------------------------

\begin{itemize}
	\item Chapter 2. Theoretical background: 
	\item Chapter 3..N-2: The naming of the following chapters relies entirely on the specific topic in question. Proposed structure should be discussed with supervisor.
	\item Chapter N-1 Results: This chapter should be the last chapter \textit{before} ``Conclusions, discussion, and ideas for further work''
	\item Chapter N. Conclusions, discussion, and ideas for further work.
	\item Bibliography
	\item Appendix A etc. (as needed): Appendix A may for example be acronyms as shown here.
\end{itemize}
