Features are individual and measurable properties of a characteristic being observed. Choosing and generating good features are an extremely important part of machine learning and statistics. These are datadriven methods where the significance and quality of the training data is crucial for the success of the classification or regression problems these models usually are applied. 

Feature engineering is the dicipline of creating new features, based on already existing data or external sources.
