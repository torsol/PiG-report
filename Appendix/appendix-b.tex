\chapter{What to put in appendixes}
\label{chp:appendixb}
\begin{info}
	This is an example of an Appendix. You can write an Appendix in the same way as a chapter, with sections, subsections, and so on. An appendix may include list of code (in case you are programming), more details about results that you have presented in the report (could be a more complete  description of results, in case you decided to focus on the most important ones in the main report), supplementary information and descriptions you have found relating to the system you are analysing, such as drawings. You may discuss with your supervisor what are relevant information for appendixes.
