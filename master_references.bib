abstract = {Over the last years the number of AIS messages generated by ships to signal their position has been increasing thus permitting decision support systems to build new strategies based on the elaboration of such data. In this paper we propose an algorithm based on a K-Nearest Neighbor classifier to predict ships routes. The algorithm was tested on real data extracted from AIS messages collected around Malta. Experiments show that our algorithm reaches a precision of 0.794, a recall of 0.785 and an accuracy of 0.931.},

@article{Dalsnes2018,
abstract = {When operating an autonomous surface vessel (ASV) in a marine environment it is vital that the vessel is equipped with a collision avoidance (COLAV) system. This system must be able to predict the trajectories of other vessels in order to avoid them. The increasingly available automatic identification system (AIS) data can be used for this task. In this paper, we present a data-driven approach to predict vessel positions 5-15 minutes into the future using AIS data. The predictions are given as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), thus the predictions give a measure of uncertainty and can handle multimodality. A nearest neighbor algorithm is applied on two different data structures. Tests to determine the accuracy and covariance consistency of both structures are performed on real data.},

@article{Tu2020,
abstract = {The prosperity of artificial intelligence has aroused intensive interests in intelligent/autonomous navigation, in which path prediction is a key functionality for decision supports, e.g. route planning, collision warning, and traffic regulation. For maritime intelligence, Automatic Identification System (AIS) plays an important role because it recently has been made compulsory for large international commercial vessels and is able to provide nearly real-time information of the vessel. Therefore AIS data based vessel path prediction is a promising way in future maritime intelligence. However, real-world AIS data collected online are just highly irregular trajectory segments (AIS message sequences) from different types of vessels and geographical regions, with possibly very low data quality. So even there are some works studying how to build a path prediction model using historical AIS data, but still, it is a very challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework to model massive historical AIS trajectory segments for accurate vessel path prediction. Experimental comparisons with existing popular methods are made to validate the proposed approach and results show that our approach could outperform the baseline methods by a wide margin.},

@article{Fossen2018,
abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of ship motion estimation using live data from Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). A globally exponentially stable observer for visualization and motion prediction of ships has been designed. Instead of using the extended Kalman filter (EKF) to deal with the kinematic nonlinearities the eXogenous Kalman Filter (XKF) is applied and by this global stability properties are proven. The proposed observer was validated using live AIS data from the Trondheim harbor in Norway and it was demonstrated that the observer tracks ships in real time. It was also demonstrated that the observer can predict the future motion of ships. The motion prediction capabilities are very useful for decision-support systems since this can be used to improve situational awareness e.g. for manned and unmanned autonomous ships that operate in common waters.},

@article{Gao2019,
abstract = {Large volumes of automatic identification system (AIS) data provide new ideas and methods for ship data mining and navigation behavior pattern analysis. However, large volumes of big data have low unit values, resulting in the need for large-scale computing, storage, and display. Learning efficiency is low and learning direction is blind and untargeted. Therefore, key feature point (KFP) extraction from the ship trajectory plays an important role in fields such as ship navigation behavior analysis and big data mining. In this paper, we propose a ship spatiotemporal KFP online extraction algorithm that is applied to AIS trajectory data. The sliding window algorithm is modified for application to ship navigation angle deviation, position deviation, and the spatiotemporal characteristics of AIS data. Next, in order to facilitate the subsequent use of the algorithm, a recommended threshold range for the corresponding two parameters is discussed. Finally, the performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the Douglas–Peucker (DP) algorithm to assess its feature extraction accuracy and operational efficiency. The results show that the proposed improved sliding window algorithm can be applied to rapidly and easily extract the KFPs from AIS trajectory data. This ability provides significant benefits for ship traffic flow and navigational behavior learning.},

@article{Xiu2019,
abstract = {In order to monitor and manage vessels in channels effectively, identification and tracking are very necessary. This work developed a maritime unmanned aerial vehicle (Mar-UAV) system equipped with a high-resolution camera and an Automatic Identification System (AIS). A multi-feature and multi-level matching algorithm using the spatiotemporal characteristics of aerial images and AIS information was proposed to detect and identify field vessels. Specifically, multi-feature information, including position, scale, heading, speed, etc., are used to match between real-time image and AIS message. Additionally, the matching algorithm is divided into two levels, point matching and trajectory matching, for the accurate identification of surface vessels. Through such a matching algorithm, the Mar-UAV system is able to automatically identify the vessel's vision, which improves the autonomy of the UAV in maritime tasks. The multi-feature and multi-level matching algorithm has been employed for the developed Mar-UAV system, and some field experiments have been implemented in the Yangzi River. The results indicated that the proposed matching algorithm and the Mar-UAV system are very significant for achieving autonomous maritime supervision.},

abstract = {The accurate estimation and prediction of the trajectories of maneuvering vessels in ocean navigation are important tools to improve maritime safety and security. Therefore, many conventional ocean navigation systems and Vessel Traffic Management {\&} Reporting Services are equipped with Radar facilities for this purpose. However, the accuracy of the predictions of maneuvering trajectories of vessels depends mainly on the goodness of estimation of vessel position, velocity and acceleration. Hence, this study presents a maneuvering ocean vessel model based on a curvilinear motion model with the measurements based on a linear position model for the same purpose. Furthermore, the system states and measurements models associated with a white Gaussian noise are also assumed. The Extended Kalman Filter is proposed as an adaptive filter algorithm for the estimation of position, velocity and acceleration that are used for prediction of maneuvering ocean vessel trajectory. Finally, the proposed models are implemented and successful computational results are obtained with respect to prediction of maneuvering trajectories of vessels in ocean navigation in this study.},

abstract = {The real-time prediction of ship behavior plays an important role in navigation and intelligent collision avoidance systems. This study developed an online real-time ship behavior prediction model by constructing a bidirectional long short-term memory recurrent neural network (BI-LSTM-RNN) that is suitable for automatic identification system (AIS) date and time sequential characteristics, and for online parameter adjustment. The bidirectional structure enhanced the relevance between historical and future data, thus improving the prediction accuracy. Through the “forget gate” of the long short-term memory (LSTM) unit, the common behavioral patterns were remembered and unique behaviors were forgotten, improving the universality of the model. The BI-LSTM-RNN was trained using 2015 AIS data from Tianjin Port waters. The results indicate that the BI-LSTM-RNN effectively predicted the navigational behaviors of ships. This study contributes significantly to the increased efficiency and safety of sea operations. The proposed method could potentially be applied as the predictive foundation for various intelligent systems, including intelligent collision avoidance, vessel route planning, operational efficiency estimation, and anomaly detection systems.},
